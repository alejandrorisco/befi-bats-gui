# About BaTS and Befi-BaTS versions:

BaTS has been under development since 2006. As a result there are multiple versions of the software, and the naming/versioning hasn't been all that consistent...

'BaTS' is taken to mean the package for estimating the core topology-based trait association statistics (AI, PS and MC), reported in Parker et al. (2008).

'Befi-BaTS' is a modification to BaTS (under intermittent development during 2007-2009) which incorporates additional statistics based on tree branch lengths (UniFrac, NTI/NRI, and PD) as well as the existing BaTS statistics. This is currently unpublished. 

To simplify things, all previous versions have been retroactively named in (reasonably) close accordance with Semantic Versioning principles. 

The **stable, published, topology-statistics-only version of BaTS** has therefore been designated 'v0.9.0' and can be found [here](https://github.com/lonelyjoeparker/befi-bats-gui/tree/master/binaries/BaTS-current).

The latest **development build** of BaTS, a.k.a. 'Befi-BaTS' is currently at v0.10.1, and can be found [here](https://github.com/lonelyjoeparker/befi-bats-gui/tree/master/binaries/Befi-BaTS-development). Note that this is unpublished and can't be considered trusted/tested.
