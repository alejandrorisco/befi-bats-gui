## FAQs ##

* *How do I know what the 'state_0','state_1' etc in the output of the MC statistic refer to?*
  - These will take the same order as the input states, so if your inputs were 'black, red, red, green' (in that order), the input states will map:
    - 'black'=>state_0
    - 'red'=>state_1
    - 'green'=>state_2
    - ... etc
  
* *How do I report an error/request a change?*
